The Boss: Yo! Welcome to the crew, intern! Ready to dive into the epic world of GOT RIZZ? Let me give you the lowdown.
- Hit me with that knowledge!

The Boss: So, GenZ peeps aren't exactly glued to the tube these days. TV ratings are in the dumps, but fear not! We've birthed the GOT RIZZ TV talent show – tailor-made for the GenZ vibe. It's all about the edgy acts, the spicy talk, and those epic moments, both the wins and the fails, you feel me?

The Boss: But here's the sitch – you know how GenZ has the attention span of a goldfish? Yeah, we gotta keep 'em hooked. After a few minutes, they start daydreaming about their avocado toast or whatever. So, it's on you to keep 'em engaged and feeling the vibes.

The Boss: Your mission is to ride shotgun on those talent performances. Tell the audience when to laugh or clap – we got this big banner for that. It's like a GenZ instruction manual for emotions, ya dig?

The Boss: And, oh boy, we need more camera cuts than a blockbuster movie. Every time you throw out the emotion cue, sniff out the most expressive souls in the crowd and get 'em on the screen. We're talking wild cheering, intense booing – make it pop!

The Boss: But hey, we can't afford a vibe check fail, or we'll be the laughing stock of the town. You got five nights to prove you're the real deal. Keep that crowd on their toes, cut to the hype, and let's take this talent show to new heights with the GenZ squad!

The Boss: Good luck, fam! May the vibes be ever in your favor.
